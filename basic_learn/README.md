# Basic Learning:
In this section you will get to learn the basics of deep learning concpepts

## Logistic Regression with small data set (10 training example):
This part partains to the basics of the machine learning. There are two files:
1. skleran_linear_logistic.py- It uses scikit-learn's linear regression model to fit the training data. It uses small_data.csv dataset. It is jus to understand how to preprocess the tabular data and perform logistic regression.
2. numpy_one_layer_logistic.py- Logistic Regression can be thought of a one layer neural network. 

So, a single layer neural network has been implemented with corresponding mathematical model. The mathematical model can be found in the video lecture by Andrew Ng. Just see these two videos -

With these two tutorial you would get the basic knowlege of logistic regression, templates as how to pre-process dataset (The preprocessing step has been taken from Deep-Learning A-Z course material) and the need for larger dataset.
